4. Tips : How To Get Maximum Value From This Course
===================================================

1. Enjoy Learning
2. Recommended approach: Watch 5-10 minutes without typing and try to understand the concepts, then pause and try to replicate them in the environemtn. Absorb the knowledge
3. Use subtitles if words are not recognisable because of the dialect
4. Use video speed management if you can handle faster or slower course speed
5. The course is structured specifically NOT to skip any lessons. We will start slow and proceed faster so any skipped lessons can cause fondusion later in the course. Not mandatory lessons will be marked as optional.
6. If we stuck on a issue we can use Q&A section of the course, use stack overflow, Google or ask AI agent
7. We will use the latest version of the used software tools in the course
